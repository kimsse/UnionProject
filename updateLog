- Finished some of the features of file section, now you can use the file section with the following commands:
add file <YOUR FILE LOCATION>
delete file <YOUR FILE NAME>
info file <YOUR FILE NAME>
list file
open file <YOUR FILE NAME>

All the files that you imported is just copy, not moving. And delete command will only delete the file inside your program, instead of deleting the source file.

- Add file: settings.json and info.json. They are in the data folder. You can change your preferences of this program at here. The settings programs for these files are coming soon

- Start the tesing of the new GUI

- The brand new setup programs help users to configure their Union Project much more easily when it is the first time to use it.

- This version is only for Windows, other platforms are developing, and they will come out soon.

- We formatlize the output of list command. Now it will appear in a more beautiful way.
